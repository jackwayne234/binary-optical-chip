# Setting Up Academic Profiles

This guide helps you establish your presence on major academic platforms to ensure your research is discoverable and citable.

## 1. Google Scholar Profile

Google Scholar is the most widely used academic search engine. A verified profile tracks your citations and increases visibility.

### Steps to Set Up:
1.  **Go to:** [scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com/)
2.  **Click:** "My Profile" (top left)
3.  **Log in:** Use your Google account (`chrisriner45@gmail.com`)
4.  **Fill in details:**
    *   **Name:** Christopher Riner
    *   **Affiliation:** Independent Researcher (or "Wavelength-Division Ternary Optical Computer Project")
    *   **Email for verification:** If you have an `.edu` email, use it. If not, you can still create a profile but it might not be "verified" in search results immediately.
    *   **Areas of interest:** Optical Computing, Ternary Logic, Photonics, Open Source Hardware
5.  **Add Articles:**
    *   Google might automatically find your Zenodo paper.
    *   **If not found automatically:** Click the `+` button → "Add articles manually" or "Add articles by group".
    *   Search for your paper title: "Wavelength-Division Ternary Logic: Bypassing the Radix Economy Penalty in Optical Computing"
6.  **Profile Visibility:** Make it **Public**.

### Tips:
*   Link your co-authors if you have any.
*   Keep your profile photo professional.
*   Add a link to your GitHub repo in your bio if possible.

## 2. ResearchGate

ResearchGate is a social networking site for scientists and researchers to share papers, ask questions, and find collaborators.

### Steps to Set Up:
1.  **Go to:** [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/)
2.  **Click:** "Join for free"
3.  **Select Category:** "Not a researcher" (if you don't have an institutional email yet) or "Academic/Student" if you have a .edu email.
    *   *Note:* ResearchGate can be strict about requiring an institutional email. If you struggle to join as an independent researcher, you can try registering as a "Corporate/Government/NGO" researcher if applicable to your Navy background, or look for the "Independent Researcher" flow if they currently offer it.
4.  **Complete Profile:**
    *   Add your skills (Optics, Python, Arduino, etc.)
5.  **Add Research:**
    *   Click "Add new" (top right)
    *   Select "Preprint" (since your paper is on Zenodo)
    *   Upload your PDF (`Wavelength_Ternary_Computing-4.pdf`)
    *   **DOI:** Use your paper DOI `10.5281/zenodo.18437600`
    *   **License:** CC BY 4.0 (Allows you to share it freely)
6.  **Add Software:**
    *   You can also add your software as "Code" or "Data" using the software DOI.

## 3. ORCID (Already Setup!)

**Your ORCID:** [0009-0008-9448-9033](https://orcid.org/0009-0008-9448-9033)

### Action Items:
1.  **Log in to ORCID.**
2.  **Verify Works:** Ensure Zenodo has automatically pushed your paper and software to your ORCID record.
3.  **Add Funding:** If you have any grants.
4.  **Add Education/Employment:** Add your Navy experience and any degrees. This builds credibility.
5.  **Websites:** Add links to:
    *   Your GitHub Repo
    *   Your Zenodo Records
    *   Your new Google Scholar / ResearchGate profiles (once created)

## 4. OSF (Open Science Framework)

OSF is great for managing the entire research lifecycle and integrates with GitHub.

### Steps to Set Up:
1.  **Go to:** [osf.io](https://osf.io/)
2.  **Sign Up:** Free account.
3.  **Create a New Project:** "Wavelength-Division Ternary Optical Computer"
4.  **Add-ons:**
    *   Go to Project Settings → Add-ons
    *   Enable **GitHub**
    *   Connect to your `jackwayne234/-wavelength-ternary-optical-computer` repo.
5.  **Description:** Copy from your README.
6.  **Make Public:** Toggle the project to Public.
7.  **DOI:** OSF can also generate a DOI for the project itself if you want a top-level identifier for the whole initiative (optional since you have Zenodo).

## 5. Hackaday.io (For Hardware Visibility)

Since this is an Open Hardware project, Hackaday is crucial for community visibility.

### Steps to Set Up:
1.  **Go to:** [hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/)
2.  **Create Account.**
3.  **Start a Project:**
    *   **Title:** Wavelength-Division Ternary Optical Computer
    *   **Description:** "Building a ternary computer using light instead of transistors to bypass the radix economy penalty."
    *   **Tags:** #optical-computing, #ternary, #homebrew-computer, #laser
4.  **Logs:** Copy your "Build Logs" from your documentation here as "Project Logs".
5.  **Files:** Link to your GitHub and Zenodo.
6.  **Submit:** Submit to contests (like the Hackaday Prize) when active!

## 6. LinkedIn (Professional Networking)

Don't forget to showcase this on your professional profile.

1.  **Add to "Projects" section:**
    *   Title: Lead Researcher - Wavelength-Division Ternary Optical Computer
    *   Description: "Open source research project developing a novel optical computing architecture using wavelength-division multiplexing to implement balanced ternary logic..."
    *   Link: Your GitHub or Zenodo DOI.
2.  **Add to "Publications":**
    *   Add your paper details.
3.  **Post an Update:** Share your new DOIs and open source release!

## 📂 Import Helper

I've created a `citations.bib` file in your repository root. You can upload this file to many of these services to automatically import your publication details without typing them manually.
