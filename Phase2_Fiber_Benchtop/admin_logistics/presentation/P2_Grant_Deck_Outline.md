# Presentation Outline: 10GHz Passive Ternary Logic
**Target Audience:** Grant Committees (SBIR), Deep Tech Angels, Academic Collaborators
**Goal:** Prove that the architecture scales to GHz speeds using standard parts.

## Slide 1: Beyond the Breadboard
*   **Visual:** Comparison of Phase 1 (Plastic/Visible) vs. Phase 2 (Fiber/Infrared).
*   **Message:** "From Proof-of-Concept to High-Speed Reality."

## Slide 2: The Architecture (ITU Grid)
*   **Diagram:** The C-Band Map.
    *   Ch30 (-1), Ch35 (0), Ch40 (+1).
*   **Advantage:** Uses off-the-shelf telecom infrastructure ($500B industry ecosystem) to build a new type of computer.

## Slide 3: Zero-Power Logic
*   **Visual:** The "Passive Inverter" Schematic.
*   **Data:** 
    *   Power Consumption: ~0 Watts.
    *   Latency: Time-of-flight only.
*   **Impact:** Massive reduction in heat for data center logic.

## Slide 4: Density Proof (The Eye Diagram)
*   **Visual:** The 3-Level Eye Diagram (Placeholder for Oscilloscope Screenshot).
*   **Key Metric:** 1.58 bits per symbol (vs 1 bit for binary).
*   **Conclusion:** More data, same bandwidth.

## Slide 5: The Roadmap to Silicon
*   **Text:** "Phase 2 validates the logic. Phase 3 prints it on a chip."
*   **Ask:** Funding required for MPW (Multi-Project Wafer) fabrication.
