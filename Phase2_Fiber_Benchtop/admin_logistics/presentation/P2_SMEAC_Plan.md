# OPERATION: LIGHTSPEED (SMEAC Plan)

## 1. SITUATION
**The "Valley of Death" in Hard Tech:**
While the Phase 1 prototype proves the logic, the industry demands speed and efficiency metrics before investment.
*   **Current Limitations:** Phase 1 uses slow sensors (milliseconds) and open-air optics (noisy).
*   **Industry Standard:** Telecom networks run at 10GHz+ using C-Band Infrared.
*   **The Competitor Status:**
    *   **Lightmatter:** Moving to Chiplet Interconnects.
    *   **Ayar Labs:** Moving to CPO (Co-Packaged Optics).
    *   **The Gap:** None are pursuing *Ternary Logic* on standard fiber rails. They are optimizing the road (interconnects) but keeping the slow cars (binary chips).
*   **Our Advantage:** We can use their own infrastructure (Standard Fiber/SFP+ modules) to build a faster, denser computer.

## 2. MISSION
**Objective:**
To build and benchmark a **10GHz Fiber-Optic Ternary Benchtop** that proves the architecture scales to telecom speeds using passive routing logic.

**Success Criteria:**
*   **Speed:** Demonstrate >1 GHz switching speed.
*   **Density:** Capture a "3-Level Eye Diagram" (Ternary) on an Oscilloscope.
*   **Efficiency:** Measure ~0 Watt power consumption for the Passive Inverter gate.

## 3. EXECUTION
**Concept of Operations:**
Transition from "Visual/Artistic" demo to "Scientific/Engineering" benchmark.

**Key Maneuvers (The Benchmarking Steps):**
1.  **The Setup:** Connect the Tunable SFP+ array (Ch30, 35, 40) to the FPGA driver.
2.  **The Inversion Test:** Route the 10GHz stream through the "Passive Fiber Cross." Verify Signal Integrity on the scope.
3.  **The Density Test:** Drive the link with random Ternary data. Capture the Eye Diagram to prove 1.58 bits/symbol.
4.  **The Benefit:** "We just transmitted 58% more data than a binary system using the *exact same* fiber cable."

## 4. ADMIN & LOGISTICS
**Materiel Required:**
*   **Hardware:** Fiber Benchtop (SFP+ Array, Mux/DeMux, Scope).
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Whitepaper: "10GHz Passive Ternary Logic on Standard SMF-28."
    *   Grant Application Pack (SBIR/NSF).
*   **Visual Aids:**
    *   Live Oscilloscope Feed (The "Money Shot").
    *   PowerPoint Deck: "Bypassing the Radix Economy Penalty."
*   **Logistics:**
    *   Access to High-Speed Scope (Rental or University Lab Partner).
    *   Clean fiber cleaning supplies (Kimwipes, Click-cleaners).
