# Presentation Outline: The Macro-Scale Ternary Computer
**Target Audience:** Hackaday Prize Judges, Maker Faires, General Tech Enthusiasts
**Goal:** Show that "Optical Computing" is accessible and solves the "Radix Economy" problem.

## Slide 1: Title Slide
*   **Visual:** High-res photo of the 24x24 board glowing in a dark room (Red, Green, Blue beams visible).
*   **Title:** Bypassing Moore's Law with Light.
*   **Subtitle:** A Wavelength-Division Ternary Computer Prototype.
*   **Name:** [Your Name]

## Slide 2: The Problem (The Ternary Paradox)
*   **Text:** 
    *   Base-3 (Ternary) is 1.58x more efficient than Binary.
    *   Electronic Ternary is too expensive (40x transistors).
    *   WE NEED A NEW MEDIUM.

## Slide 3: The Solution (Color as Value)
*   **Visual:** Simple diagram showing Red (-1), Green (0), Blue (+1).
*   **Key Concept:** "In Electronics, we pay for states with hardware. In Optics, we pay with Color."
*   **Impact:** Complexity does not scale with the number of states.

## Slide 4: The Prototype (Under the Hood)
*   **Visual:** Exploded view of the 3D Printed Integration Chamber.
*   **Tech Stack:**
    *   ESP32 Logic Controller.
    *   AS7341 Spectral Sensor.
    *   Visible Light Lasers (Red/Green/Blue).

## Slide 5: The Demo
*   **Visual:** Video clip of "1 + -1 = 0" (Blue + Red -> Purple).
*   **Action:** Real-time calculation showing immediate response.

## Slide 6: What's Next?
*   **Text:** Scaling to 10GHz (Phase 2 Fiber Benchtop).
*   **Call to Action:** "Follow the project on Hackaday.io / Zenodo."
