# OPERATION: PROTO-ONE (SMEAC Plan)

## 1. SITUATION
**Current Landscape of Computing:**
Moore's Law is dead. Traditional electronic computing has hit a thermal and physical wall.
*   **The Competitors:**
    *   **Lightmatter/Ayar Labs:** Focused on *moving* binary data faster (interconnects) but still rely on inefficient binary logic for computation.
    *   **Luminous Computing:** Struggled with the complexity of monolithic binary optical computing.
    *   **Intel:** Excellent at manufacturing but locked into legacy binary architectures.
*   **The Gap:** No major player is addressing the fundamental mathematical inefficiency of Binary (Base-2).
*   **The Opportunity:** Ternary (Base-3) logic is 1.58x more efficient (Radix Economy). Light is naturally multi-valued (wavelengths/colors), making it the perfect medium for this shift.

## 2. MISSION
**Objective:**
To demonstrate a functional **Wavelength-Division Ternary Computer Prototype** (24x24" scale) that validates the architecture by performing arithmetic operations using chromatic mixing logic.

**Success Criteria:**
*   Visible demonstration of 1 + -1 = 0 (Blue + Red = Purple).
*   Validation that logic gates can be implemented with passive optical routing.

## 3. EXECUTION
**Concept of Operations:**
We will present a "Scale Model" of a photonic computer, enlarged to human-visible size to demystify the physics.

**Key Maneuvers (The Demo Steps):**
1.  **Initialization:** Power up the 3D-printed Optical Core; verify Red/Grn/Blu rails are active.
2.  **The Input:** User enters "1 + -1" via the control terminal.
3.  **The Process (Visual):** Audience sees the Blue beam and Red beam physically travel through the "Integration Chamber."
4.  **The Result:** The Sensor reads the "Purple" mix and displays "Result: 0" instantly.
5.  **The Payoff:** Explain that this same logic, when shrunk to a chip, consumes near-zero energy.

**Future Benefit:**
This architecture offers a path to computing systems that run cooler and process more data per cycle than any electronic equivalent.

## 4. ADMIN & LOGISTICS
**Materiel Required:**
*   **The Prototype:** Fully assembled 24x24" board with dark-box cover.
*   **Power:** 20,000mAh USB-C Battery Bank (for mobile reliability).
*   **Literature:**
    *   One-Page "How it Works" Flyers (QR Code to Zenodo Paper).
    *   Business Cards with Project Repo Link.
*   **Visual Aids:**
    *   Laptop running the Python Controller (High-Contrast Terminal).
    *   "Ternary Logic Truth Table" Poster (Color-coded).
*   **Giveaways:** Small 3D-printed "Ternary Cubes" (Red/Grn/Blu PLA mix) as memorable tokens.
