Subject: MPW Inquiry - 81-Trit Ternary Optical Processor

---

Hello,

I'm an independent researcher developing a ternary optical computing architecture that uses wavelength-division multiplexing for arithmetic operations. I'm interested in fabricating a proof-of-concept chip through your MPW program.

*Project summary:*

The design is an 81-trit optical ALU that encodes ternary logic states (-1, 0, +1) as three wavelengths (1.55, 1.30, and 1.00 μm). Arithmetic operations are performed via sum-frequency generation in a χ² nonlinear waveguide. The architecture is documented in a peer-reviewed publication on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18437600).

*Design details:*

- Die size estimate: ~4 × 6 mm (full 81-trit), smaller single-ALU test structures available
- Waveguide width: 0.5 μm
- Key components: ring resonators, MMI couplers, χ² mixer, photodetector
- Generated with gdsfactory (generic PDK - ready for layer mapping)

*Questions:*

1. Is your platform compatible with this design? Specifically:
   - Waveguide core index ~2.2 (LiNbO3 or high-index SiN)
   - χ² nonlinear mixing capability (or can I bond/deposit nonlinear material?)

2. What are your current MPW schedules and pricing for a design of this size?

3. What PDK and design rules should I use to regenerate the layout for your process?

4. Do you offer design review services before tape-out?

I have a complete design summary, GDS file, and simulation data ready to share. The full project repository is public: https://github.com/jackwayne234/-wavelength-ternary-optical-computer

Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
