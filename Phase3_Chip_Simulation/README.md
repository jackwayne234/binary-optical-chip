# Phase 3: Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC)
**Status:** Design Pending (Post-Simulation)
**Goal:** Fabricate the Ternary Logic architecture on a Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) chip.

## Future Contents
*   **GDSII Layouts:** The manufacturing files for the foundry.
*   **Mask Designs:** Lithography layers.
*   **Testing Scripts:** Automated wafer probing logic.

*> Note: The FDTD Simulations and Theoretical Design files have been moved to the `../Research` directory to serve as the foundation for this hardware phase.*
