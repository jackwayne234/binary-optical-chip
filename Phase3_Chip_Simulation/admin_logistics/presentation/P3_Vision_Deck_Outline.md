# Presentation Outline: The Silicon Photonic Ternary Chip
**Target Audience:** VC Firms (Series A), Semiconductor Foundries (AIM Photonics, AMF), DARPA MTO
**Goal:** Secure funding for a Multi-Project Wafer (MPW) run.

## Slide 1: The End of Moore's Law
*   **Graph:** Transistor scaling costs vs. Performance gains.
*   **Problem:** We can't shrink transistors much further. We need *denser logic*.

## Slide 2: The Solution: Lithium Niobate on Insulator (LNOI)
*   **Visual:** Render of the Phase 3 Chip Design (from Meep simulations).
*   **Tech:** Using Pockels Effect for ultra-fast switching.

## Slide 3: The "Trit" Chip Architecture
*   **Diagram:** 
    *   Input: 3 Waveguides (Red, Grn, Blu).
    *   Process: Ring Resonators (Switching) + SFG Waveguides (Logic).
    *   Output: Single Waveguide.
*   **Advantage:** One optical gate replaces ~40 transistors.

## Slide 4: Validated by Simulation
*   **Visual:** FDTD simulation video (from Research folder) showing light bending and mixing.
*   **Data:** "Physics verified in Meep. Ready for Fabrication."

## Slide 5: The Ask
*   **Milestone:** Tape-out of 1st Test Chip.
*   **Budget:** $[Amount] for MPW Run + Packaging.
