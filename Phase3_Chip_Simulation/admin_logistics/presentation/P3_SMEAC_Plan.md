# OPERATION: SILICON DAWN (SMEAC Plan)

## 1. SITUATION
**The Post-Moore Era:**
Semiconductor scaling has stalled. The cost per transistor is rising. The industry is desperate for a paradigm shift that increases compute density without shrinking nodes further.
*   **The Competitor Analysis:**
    *   **AI Hardware:** GPUs are hitting thermal limits (1000W+ per chip).
    *   **Optical Competitors:** Still trapping themselves in binary logic, requiring massive arrays of Mach-Zehnder Modulators that consume too much space.
*   **Our Solution:** The **Ternary Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC)**.
    *   By moving to Base-3, we reduce the component count (wire complexity) by ~40% for the same compute power.
    *   By using LNOI (Lithium Niobate), we achieve sub-volt switching.

## 2. MISSION
**Objective:**
To secure Series A funding / Foundry Partnerships to fabricate the **First Commercial Ternary Optical Chip**.

**Success Criteria:**
*   Tape-out of a Multi-Project Wafer (MPW) design.
*   Fabrication of the first batch of 50 test chips.
*   Validation of the chip in a standard PCIe or Server Blade form factor.

## 3. EXECUTION
**Concept of Operations:**
Move from "Science Project" to "Product." Focus shifts to Yield, Cost, and Scalability.

**Key Maneuvers (The Roadmap):**
1.  **Design Lock:** Finalize GDSII files from Phase 3 simulations.
2.  **Foundry Selection:** Partner with AIM Photonics (USA) or AMF (Singapore) for the MPW run.
3.  **The "Hello World" Chip:** A simple 4-Trit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) test chip.
4.  **The Scale-Up:** Demonstrate a chip that outperforms an NVIDIA A100 in *specific* sparse-logic workloads (efficiency-wise).

**Future Benefit:**
A new class of processor that solves the energy crisis in Data Center AI.

## 4. ADMIN & LOGISTICS
**Materiel Required:**
*   **The Asset:** The GDSII Design Files (IP).
